# Battleboats
Battleboats is a game similar to battleship in which the user attempts to sink the opponents battleboats. The game consists of three game modes with differing amounts of ships and an additional mode in which you can see the location of all of the boats.

and at line 7 press the green triangle, then press (Run 'Game') to compile and run our program


Assumptions:

Assume that when asking for BattleBoat and Debug mode, we have a friendly user.
